# 📘 Library Management System Application  

This project is a simple Python-based Library Management System developed during my first internship.  
It manages a collection of books by allowing the user to display, issue, return, add, sort, and browse books by genre — all through a console-based interface.

## 💡 Introduction  

The Library Management System (LMS) is designed to make basic library operations faster and more organized.  
Instead of keeping manual records, it stores book data like title, status, and borrower name digitally in a text file.  
The project helped me understand the practical use of file handling, data structures, and object-oriented programming in Python.

## ⚙️ Features  

- Display all books with their ID, title, and status  
- Issue and return books with date tracking  
- Add new books to the library  
- Sort books alphabetically using Merge Sort  
- Browse books by genre  
- Store and update all records automatically in a file

## 🧠 Concepts Used  

- File Handling — Reading and updating data from a text file  
- Dictionaries and Lists — Storing and managing book information  
- Object-Oriented Programming — Using classes and methods for cleaner structure  
- Algorithms — Implemented merge sort for arranging books alphabetically  
- Control Structures — Loops and conditionals for user choices  
- Error Handling — Try-except blocks to handle invalid inputs smoothly

## 🔄 How It Works  

1. When the program starts, it loads the book data from the file.  
2. It displays a main menu with options like Display, Issue, Add, Return, Sort, Browse, or Quit.  
3. Based on the user’s input, the respective function runs.  
4. The file and dictionary get updated every time a change is made.  
5. The program ends gracefully with a goodbye message when the user quits.

## 🖥️ Output Overview  

- The interface shows menu options for easy navigation.  
- Issued books are marked with borrower names and dates.  
- Adding or returning books updates the main list instantly.  
- Sorting arranges all titles alphabetically.  
- Browsing by genre helps users find books of similar types quickly.

## 🙏 Acknowledgement  

I’d like to thank my internship tutors and mentors for helping me connect what I’ve been learning with how things actually work.
As a first-year Computer Engineering student, this project was a small step in figuring out how logic turns into something functional — and occasionally, why it doesn’t.
